    I am define by my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith">faith</a> in <a href="https://www.moodybible.org/beliefs/positional-statements/deity-of-jesus-christ/">Jesus Christ</a>, which I invited in my life as <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Jesus-Christ,-Lord">Lord</a> and <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Jesus-Christ,-Savior">Savior</a> on I was 17 years old. My story with God start in my childhood when my grandparents describe Him as my creator. My Grandfather told me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOUV7mWDI34">the story of Noah who
    was delegated by God to build an Ark</a>, because the weaknesses of the people where determine God to destroy His Creation by Flood. So I discover that upset God is not smart and it has consequences that can make my life miserable. So all my
    childhood I try to please this God which was not so personal but more like a distance entity who has the power to punish me if I am not please Him. On the other hand my grandmother teach me how to pray and I did that with religious conscience.
    Then when I was 14 years old I become rebellious against God because I fell to go to a good high-school so I blame God because my failure. For 3 year I ignore God but when I discover He died for my sin to give me life I surrender to Him. After 26
    year I have no regrets for that decision. My faith is what define me.
